# 3. Implement monitoring system and cover key components of the pipeline and application

Date: 2023-05-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

DevOps team and infrastructure resources (Cloud).

## Decision

We will choose a suitable and easily configurable mounting system and deploy it in the cloud. We will test it and after that will add critical metrics for each key component of the system and the Pipeline.

## Consequences

Availability of a monitoring system and information about critical components of the system.Itâ€™s possible that in the future the requirements for the monitoring system may change and this will become unnecessary.
